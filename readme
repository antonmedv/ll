ll – a small utility to list files in the current directory.

# Why?
Because I wanted to display files in columns with git status.

# Rationalize
One entry per line for lots of files can't be fitted on a screen
and requires scrolling. With the multi-columns layout, space can be
used more efficiently. At the same time, git status information also
often required. Which makes usage of colors perfect job.

# Options or flags?
No.

# Alternatives?
alias ll='ls -la'
